## Agile-Scrum Approach
This project followed the Agile-Scrum methodology to ensure continuous development and integration of features. The Requirement to Use Case Matrix and Increment Matrix played a crucial role in aligning project requirements with development efforts and organizing task dependencies effectively:

- **Requirement to Use Case Matrix**: This matrix helped us identify and prioritize the essential use cases required to meet the project goals, ensuring that development efforts were aligned with high-priority requirements.

- **Increment Matrix**: By breaking down the use cases and tracking dependencies, the Increment Matrix facilitated structured planning across sprints, optimizing resource allocation and task assignment for each iteration.

Additional Scrum practices included:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Defined tasks and features for each sprint.
2. **Daily Standups**: Conducted daily meetings to discuss progress and address blockers.
3. **Sprint Review**: Reviewed completed work at the end of each sprint.
